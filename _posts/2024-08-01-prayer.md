God,

Thank you for the way that we leave impressions on one another, forming each other in a mutual spiritual unfolding of who we will become.  Help us to love one another.  With your Grace, may we form each other into people who are humble, patient, gentle and kind; caring, honest, strong and self-assured of our own worthiness of love; free to create, following our inspirations to discover our purpose -- as we each strive to cultivate these fruits within ourselves:  responsibly growing conscious, reaching out further in love.

Amen
