> 1 The spacious firmament on high, <br/>
> with all the blue ethereal sky, <br/>
> and spangled heavens, a shining frame, <br/>
> their great Original proclaim. <br/>
> The unwearied sun from day to day <br/>
> does his Creator's power display, <br/>
> and publishes to every land <br/>
> the work of an almighty hand.
>
> 2 Soon as the evening shades prevail <br/>
> the moon takes up the wondrous tale, <br/>
> and nightly to the listening earth <br/>
> repeats the story of her birth; <br/>
> whilst all the stars that round her burn, <br/>
> and all the planets in their turn, <br/>
> confirm the tidings, as they roll, <br/>
> and spread the truth from pole to pole.
>
> 3 What though in solemn silence all <br/>
> move round the dark terrestrial ball; <br/>
> what though nor real voice nor sound <br/>
> amid their radiant orbs be found; <br/>
> in reason's ear they all rejoice, <br/>
> and utter forth a glorious voice, <br/>
> for ever singing as they shine, <br/>
> 'The hand that made us is divine.' <br/>
>
> -- Joseph Addison (1712)
