Father's Day, 2025-06-15

God,

Each of us is a living link in the Great Chain of Generation.  Each of us has a father.  I thank You for the love You have offered through the good fathers of the past:  those who willed and strove to become channels of Your goodness, nurturance, protection, love and kindness to their children.  I thank You for Your healing impulses, and for the Spirit-Breath and -Blood of Goodness that is Your action in the world.  I thank You for forming Good Fathers into being and time.

I thank You that, despite the failings of our fathers, we yet know what it is to be virtuous, because You have taught us, and You have planted within each of our hearts a seed of striving to become Good.

I humbly pray to become like You -- to become a good father to Your children, whom You have entrusted to my care, and to be a good partner to their mother.  I acknowledge my own limitations, deficiencies and weakness.  I ask for Your direction, wisdom and insight, that I may perceive what is right-action in the day-to-day life of our home.  I ask for Your strength and endurance, that I may sustain Your work of fatherhood and partnership and not falter.

When I do inevitably falter, please grant me forgiveness and show me Your grace in reconciliation with my children.  Help me not to ruminate on my own failings, but instead to resolve anew my Will to Be Good, with Your help, and to gently earn trust again, as I cultivate within myself Your gentleness and grace.

I pray for anyone whose ancestors in the Great Chain of Generation failed to give them the love and security they so essentially needed.  I humbly acknowledge the Wounded Patriarchy that is yet such a source of affliction in our world.

I pray for all fathers and children whose loved ones have been taking from them, by no fault of their own, but by the cruel and misguided hand of another.  I pray for all fathers who are struggling to provide for their children, against the adversaries of natural circumstance or human malice.  Please, God, provide for Your Children.  Please, God, let Your justice and righteousness be manifest and realized in our world.  Please, God, help us to turn our wills.  Open our hearts.  Change our minds.

I ask You, the Perfect Father and Mother of us all, to send Your Redemptive healing and love to anyone hurting with father wounds -- especially those who are wounding others.  Please help us to break this cycle of wounding.

Source and Sustainer of Our Being, may all of us, who so desperately need Your love, have the courage to Receive it.  Help us to Surrender to You our instinctual needs for survival, security, affection, esteem, power and control.  Please, God, open our hearts.  Change our minds.

I humbly offer You my Willing and my Striving.

Help me to never take for granted the awesome gift of my family, whom You have entrusted to me, and to whom You have entrusted me.

Through our stewardship of Your Family in Our Living Form, with Your help, may Our Home be a refuge to our children, a humble manifestation of Your Glory on earth.  In all Homes, in all Places, may Your Glory not be hidden, but realized and known, through the gift of Your grace, sought by our striving.

Amen.
