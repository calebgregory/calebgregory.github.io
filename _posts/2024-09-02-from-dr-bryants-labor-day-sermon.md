title: From Rev. Bryant's Sermon for Labor Day
---

Thanks to Rev. Dr. Laura A. Bryant for sharing these prayers and poem in her sermon at St. John's Episcopal Church, Johnson City, TN, this Sunday.

> O God, your unfailing providence sustains the world we live in and the life we live:  Watch over those, both night and day, who work while others sleep, and grant that we may never forget that our common life depends upon each other's toil; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  _Amen_.

__Mary Oliver's poem, "Singapore"__.  This poem was originally printed in _Poetry_ magazine in July 1988 ([link](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=152&issue=4&page=10)).

> In Singapore, in the airport, <br/>
> A darkness was ripped from my eyes. <br/>
> In the women’s restroom, one compartment stood open. <br/>
> A woman knelt there, washing something in the white bowl. <br/>
>
> Disgust argued in my stomach <br/>
> and I felt, in my pocket, for my ticket. <br/>
>
> A poem should always have birds in it. <br/>
> Kingfishers, say, with their bold eyes and gaudy wings. <br/>
> Rivers are pleasant, and of course trees. <br/>
> A waterfall, or if that’s not possible, a fountain rising and falling. <br/>
> A person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem. <br/>
>
> When the woman turned I could not answer her face. <br/>
> Her beauty and her embarrassment struggled together, <br/>
> and neither could win. <br/>
> She smiled and I smiled. What kind of nonsense is this? <br/>
> Everybody needs a job. <br/>
>
> Yes, a person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem. <br/>
> But first we must watch her as she stares down at her labor, <br/>
> which is dull enough. <br/>
> She is washing the tops of the airport ashtrays, as big as hubcaps, <br/>
> with a blue rag. <br/>
> Her small hands turn the metal, scrubbing and rinsing. <br/>
> She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river. <br/>
> Her dark hair is like the wing of a bird. <br/>
>
> I don’t doubt for a moment that she loves her life. <br/>
> And I want her to rise up from the crust and the slop and <br/>
> fly down to the river. <br/>
> This probably won’t happen. <br/>
> But maybe it will. <br/>
> If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it? <br/>
>
> Of course, it isn’t. <br/>
> Neither do I mean anything miraculous, but only <br/>
> the light that can shine out of a life. I mean <br/>
> the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth, <br/>
> The way her smile was only for my sake; I mean <br/>
> the way this poem is filled with trees, and birds. <br/>

> __For Labor Day__
>
> Almighty God, you have so linked our lives one with another that all we do affects, for good or ill, all other lives:  So guide us in the work we do, that we may do it not for self alone, but for the common good; and, as we seek a proper return for our own labor, make us mindful of the rightful aspirations of other workers, and arouse our concern for those who are out of work; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  _Amen_.

> O God, who created all peoples in your image, we thank you for the wonderful diversity of races and cultures in this world.  Enrich our lives by ever-widening circles of fellowship, and show us your presence in those who differ most from us, until our knowledge of your love is made perfect in our love for all your children; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  _Amen_.
