title: From Rev. Bryant's Sermon for Labor Day
---

Thanks to Rev. Dr. Laura A. Bryant for sharing these prayers and this poem in her homily at St. John's Episcopal Church, Johnson City, TN, this Sunday.

> O God, your unfailing providence sustains the world we live in and the life we live:  Watch over those, both night and day, who work while others sleep, and grant that we may never forget that our common life depends upon each other's toil; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  _Amen_.

__Mary Oliver's poem, "Singapore"__.  This poem was originally printed in _Poetry_ magazine in July 1988 ([link](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=152&issue=4&page=10)) and later published in _House of Light_ (Beacon Press, ISBN: 978-0-8070-6810-6).

> In Singapore, in the airport, <br/>
> A darkness was ripped from my eyes. <br/>
> In the women's restroom, one compartment stood open. <br/>
> A woman knelt there, washing something in the white bowl. <br/>
>
> Disgust argued in my stomach <br/>
> and I felt, in my pocket, for my ticket. <br/>
>
> A poem should always have birds in it. <br/>
> Kingfishers, say, with their bold eyes and gaudy wings. <br/>
> Rivers are pleasant, and of course trees. <br/>
> A waterfall, or if that's not possible, a fountain rising and falling. <br/>
> A person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem. <br/>
>
> When the woman turned I could not answer her face. <br/>
> Her beauty and her embarrassment struggled together, <br/>
> and neither could win. <br/>
> She smiled and I smiled. What kind of nonsense is this? <br/>
> Everybody needs a job. <br/>
>
> Yes, a person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem. <br/>
> But first we must watch her as she stares down at her labor, <br/>
> which is dull enough. <br/>
> She is washing the tops of the airport ashtrays, as big as hubcaps, <br/>
> with a blue rag. <br/>
> Her small hands turn the metal, scrubbing and rinsing. <br/>
> She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river. <br/>
> Her dark hair is like the wing of a bird. <br/>
>
> . . .
>
> I don't doubt for a moment that she loves her life. <br/>
> And I want her to rise up from the crust and the slop and <br/>
> fly down to the river. <br/>
> This probably won't happen. <br/>
> But maybe it will. <br/>
> If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it? <br/>
>
> Of course, it isnt. <br/>
> Neither do I mean anything miraculous, but only <br/>
> the light that can shine out of a life. I mean <br/>
> the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth, <br/>
> The way her smile was only for my sake; I mean <br/>
> the way this poem is filled with trees, and birds. <br/>
>

"She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river.  Her dark hair is like the wing of a bird."

> Almighty God, you have so linked our lives one with another that all we do affects, for good or ill, all other lives:  So guide us in the work we do, that we may do it not for self alone, but for the common good; and, as we seek a proper return for our own labor, make us mindful of the rightful aspirations of other workers, and arouse our concern for those who are out of work; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  _Amen_.
