This is the blog of Caleb Gregory.  My person probably merits some kind of introduction, but in short, I am an actual human being and this website is not the work of an LLM.

This blog functions as a library of passages of books that I resonate with -- that ring true -- as well as thoughts of my own.  These words are collected here both for my own future reference and for you.

Thanks for visiting this corner of the internet.  Blessings be upon you.
